You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

 

Example 1:

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
Example 2:

Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
Code:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> sortPeople(vector<string>& names, vector<int>& heights) {
        int n=heights.size();
        unordered_map<int,string>pq;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            pq[heights[i]]=names[i];
        }
        sort(heights.begin(),heights.end(),greater<int>());
        vector<string>v;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            v.push_back(pq[heights[i]]);
            
        }
        return v;
    }
};
